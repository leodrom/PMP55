<BR>I am Valeriy Trushevsky. I study at Lviv University. I am the fifth
year student of Applied Mathematics and Informatics Faculty. I was born
on September, 8, 1976. I finished school number52. Since I had been attending
Greco-Roman fight circle for seven years, I was meant to be a sportsman.
But under the circumstances (after the sixth form) I continued my studies
in the mathematics class under the guidance of Orach. Since when I had
been working hard on mathematics. In the 11th form I look part in a contest
and obtained good results. Thanks to them I was enrolled for the Applied
Mathematics Faculty. I specialisation in interval methods for solving problems.
This is the theme of my diploma paper. After the graduation I am going
to take my Master's Degree, so I'll be able to continue my studies of intervals
(to keep on studying the intervals). At leisure I like to play basketball.
I go in for sports to keep myself in good shape.
