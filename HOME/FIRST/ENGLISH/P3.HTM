<P>The books - is my passin since the early childhood. At first I read
everything that found, but later I determinated the list of favorite
works: "Master and Margarite" by Bulgakov, The islands in the ocean"
by Haminaway, "Billion years before the endof Earth" by Strugatsky br.
Of cource  it is far to be the full list of my favorite stories.
It's icreasing permanently.</P>
<P> The poetry takes a special place in my life. A.Ahmatova, M.
Tsvetayeva, N. Gumilyov, A. Blok - most of their works I have learned
by heard. All in all I agree that the books are better to read, but
not be spoken about.

<BR><A NAME="sport"></A>
<P>I can't imagine my self without downhill ski, swimminhg, gymnastics
mountain hikes. It doesn't mean that I reached success in those kinds
of sport, it's just a part of my life. Besides, I have some new
ideads. They are to make a parachte jump and to buy a mountian bike.

<P>I admire everything that runs, flys, makes sounds. Since I was 10 I
dreamed to bee a veterinary. And sometimes I wish my dream came true.
