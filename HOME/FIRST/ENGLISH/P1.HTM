<P>On this page I'm� going to tell you about my childhood, my "teens" and
my youth (a like Gorky has). Certainly I coud egarly tell you about the
next years of my life but I'd prefer not to do that because of having no
next years.
<BR> In my green years I was lucky to receive the brillrant and especialy
unigue Irina. I didn't enjoy that name, but during 21 years we got used
to each other and now we live in harmony.
<BR>The fortune made me to born in the glorious city of� Lviv. That remarkable
event took place on August 12 1976.
<BR> After that, as all common children, I went throuch the nursery (infortunately
I haven't saved any impressions about that extraordinary institution),
then the kindergarten came and at last I found myself aboard the school
�35, where the endless 10 years of education decorated my life. The school
was the plase where I was infected by unhealthy interest to mathematics,
computer science and other exact sciences. This interest affected all my
life, as far as after the real miracle led me to the facultee ot applied
mathematics and computerscience. This is the unigne facultee that I'm trying
to graduate right now. The five years under the miserly wing of AlmaMater
passed unnoticed. During this horrible years I got used to firm ignoration
of formulas that are longer that a line, and of lectures that sugest us
to write more then 5 pages in order to derive that devil's formulas. The
years of practise rised a real maestro of� Minesweeper. That was the brightest
result of <A HREF="P2.htm">my studying</A>. Besides my studying is another piese of story. I
can't say anymething definite about my future (especially concearhing the
diploma). But due to my incorrigible optimism I hope to find the perfeet
plase in life.
