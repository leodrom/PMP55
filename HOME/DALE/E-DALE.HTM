<B>If by some mysterious way you've found this page and aren't rushing off for the next few minutes, let's get acquainted.</B>

<P><B>As you've probably already guessed (let's assume you can read and managed to get through the first line here) my name is Dmytro Zlatous (Dmytro is the first name, Zlatous the surname&mdash;spelled without the ending "t"; I'm not claiming any relation to John Chrysostom).</B>

<P><B>I was born on September&nbsp;20, 1976<IMG SRC="BOY7.GIF" HEIGHT=37 WIDTH=37 ALIGN=LEFT> (as expected, it was a Monday) in the city of Ivano-Frankivsk where my parents diligently mined the granite of science.</B>

<P><B>In my childhood my hot temper showed itself, so my parents were literally chilled by their offspring. I'd manage to soak or, even better, completely soil what adults called a "diaper," or I'd start singing from boredom (usually at night to enjoy<IMG SRC="BOY8.GIF" HEIGHT=37 WIDTH=37 ALIGN=RIGHT>my talent in the surrounding silence). Of course there were plenty of other great activities but let's not dwell&mdash;I'm sure you had no fewer tricks to make your parents happy.</B>

<P><B>So, if I haven't bored you yet, let's continue. After all the tiring moves (Ivano-Frankivsk &ndash; Radomyshl &ndash; Kyiv) I had to settle in a plain provincial town called Stryi. There I went to a cool kindergarten with the fairy-tale name "Red Riding Hood" (obviously the "hoods" were played by the kind teachers, and the "wolves" you can guess yourself).</B>

<P><B>When age allowed I took my pack and went off to gain wisdom at secondary school&nbsp;No.&nbsp;7. During those moments when I managed to make it to class my knowledge grew by leaps and bounds. The subjects I remember most were:</B>
<UL><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Algebra</FONT> &ndash; all my attempts to master long division failed miserably, so I realised a calculator is man's best friend.</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Geometry</FONT> &ndash; all the teacher's efforts to make me draw with a ruler and pencil were fruitless.</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Computer science</FONT> &ndash; those curious digits and letters flickered on that TV/typewriter hybrid.</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">History</FONT> &ndash; the whole textbook was crammed with awesome pictures.</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Russian literature</FONT> &ndash; on principle I refused to read the assigned works (I hate being told what and when to do).</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Chemistry</FONT> &ndash; always wondered if my neighbour's ruler would dissolve completely in sulfuric acid and what would happen if you "drop some of that" here.</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Physics</FONT> &ndash; a charged capacitor left on the desk was great "gin and tonic" for the curious.</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">English</FONT> &ndash; I could never understand what that "cutie" was babbling or why she looked at me with such loving eyes.</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Geography</FONT> &ndash; like Ostap Bender I wanted to know where the country is where everyone wears white pants (Rio de Janeiro).</B></UL>
<B>As you can see a whole range of subjects fascinated me for very different reasons.</B>

<P><B>When I decided I was done with secondary education (usually around 16) I had to choose a path. Since school never taught me to count properly and the mysterious symbols on that "hybrid" kept luring me, I decided: I'll study applied mathematics&mdash;perhaps by my fifth year I'll master that trickery (meaning I'll finally learn to count).</B>

<P><B>And so I landed at the mysterious Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatics where fate placed me in the Information Systems department. Now the fifth year is nearly over and I still can't count without a calculator. Alas!</B>
