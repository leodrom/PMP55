<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If by some mysterious way you got to this page and aren't in a hurry for the next few minutes, let's get acquainted.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you have probably guessed (let's assume you can read and have read the first line on this page) my name is Dmitri Zlatous (Dmitri is the first name, Zlatous is the surname &ndash; it's spelled without the final "t"; I do not claim any relation to John Chrysostom).</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born on September 20, 1976<IMG SRC="BOY7.GIF" HEIGHT=37 WIDTH=37 ALIGN=LEFT> (as expected on a Monday) in the city of Ivano-Frankivsk where my parents diligently mined the granite of science.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my childhood years my stormy temperament revealed itself, so my parents were literally chilled by their offspring. I managed to wet or even completely soil the thing they called a "diaper", or from boredom I began to sing (usually at night to enjoy<IMG SRC="BOY8.GIF" HEIGHT=37 WIDTH=37 ALIGN=RIGHT>my talent in the surrounding silence). Of course there were tons of other great activities but let's not linger &ndash; I'm sure you had no fewer ways to make your parents happy.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if I haven't bored you yet with my humble persona, let's continue. After all the weary wanderings (Ivano-Frankivsk &ndash; Radomyshl &ndash; Kyiv) I had to settle down in an unremarkable provincial town called Stryi. There I managed to attend a groovy kindergarten with the fairy-tale name "Red Riding Hood" (obviously the roles of the "hoods" were played by the nice teachers, and the "wolves" &mdash; you can guess yourself).</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the years allowed I took my pack and went to gain wisdom at secondary school #7. There (during those moments when I managed to make it to class) my knowledge grew by leaps and bounds. The subjects that stuck in my memory the most were:</B>
<UL><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Algebra</FONT> &ndash; all my attempts to learn long division failed miserably so I realised that a calculator is man's best friend.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Geometry</FONT> &ndash; all the teacher's efforts to make me draw with a ruler and pencil were in vain.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Computer science</FONT> &ndash; those curious digits and letters flickered on this TV/typewriter hybrid.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">History</FONT> &ndash; the textbook was filled with awesome pictures.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Russian literature</FONT> &ndash; on principle I didn't read the required works (I hate being told what and when to do).</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Chemistry</FONT> &ndash; always wondered if the neighbour's ruler would dissolve completely if thrown into sulfuric acid and what would happen if you "drop some of that here".</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Physics</FONT> &ndash; a charged capacitor left on the desk always served as good "gin tonic" for the curious.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">English</FONT> &ndash; I could never understand what that "cutie" was babbling and why she was looking at me with such loving eyes.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Geography</FONT> &ndash; like Ostap Bender I wanted to know where the country is where everyone wears white pants (Rio de Janeiro).</B></UL>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see a whole range of subjects interested me for very different reasons.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I decided I was done with secondary education (usually happens around 16) I had to choose my next path. Since I never learned to count properly at school and the strange characters on that "hybrid" kept calling me I decided &ndash; I'll go into applied mathematics; maybe by the fifth year I'll master that cunning wisdom (meaning I'll learn to count properly).</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I landed at the mysterious faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatics where I happened to wind up in the Information Systems department. Now the fifth year is almost over and I still can't count without a calculator. Alas!</B>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Literature</FONT> &ndash; I read everything in a row. I really like V. Pikul. I strongly recommend reading him &ndash; you'll get a lot of pleasure. Like everyone, I have a favourite book (in childhood it was "Dunno on the Moon") &ndash; "The Twelve Chairs" and "The Golden Calf" (I've reread them many times).</B>

<P>&nbsp;<img src="../../IMAGES/BALL7.GIF" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14 ALIGN=TEXTTOP><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sport</FONT> &ndash; all my thoughts are about alpine skiing (I was put on them at 11, for which I'm grateful).<IMG SRC="VVLOGO3.GIF" ALT="Vladimir Vysotsky" HEIGHT=225 WIDTH=245 ALIGN=RIGHT></B>
