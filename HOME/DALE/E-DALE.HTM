<B>If you've stumbled onto this page and have a few minutes to spare, let's get acquainted.</B>

<P><B>You've probably guessed it already (let's assume you can read and made it through the first line), my name is Dmytro Zlatous&mdash;first name Dmytro, last name Zlatous, spelled without the final "t". I'm not related to John Chrysostom.</B>

<P><B>I was born on 20 September 1976<IMG SRC="BOY7.GIF" HEIGHT=37 WIDTH=37 ALIGN=LEFT> &mdash; a Monday, naturally &mdash; in Ivano-Frankivsk where my parents were diligently chiseling away at the granite of science.</B>

<P><B>As a child I was hot-tempered, leaving my parents cold with shock. I'd manage to soak or, even better, completely ruin what grown-ups called a diaper, or I'd start singing from boredom (usually at night to enjoy<IMG SRC="BOY8.GIF" HEIGHT=37 WIDTH=37 ALIGN=RIGHT>the silence around me). There were plenty of other pursuits but let's skip them; I'm sure you had just as many ways to give your parents joy.</B>

<P><B>So, if I haven't exhausted you yet, let's continue. After the exhausting moves (Ivano-Frankivsk &ndash; Radomyshl &ndash; Kyiv) I ended up in a plain provincial town called Stryi. There I attended a wonderful kindergarten with the fairy-tale name "Red Riding Hood" (guess who played the "hoods" and who the wolves were).</B>

<P><B>When I was old enough I shouldered my bag and set off for secondary school&nbsp;No.&nbsp;7. Whenever I actually made it to class my knowledge grew by leaps and bounds. The subjects I remember best were:</B>
<UL><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Algebra</FONT> &ndash; all attempts to master long division failed miserably, so I concluded the calculator is man's best friend.</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Geometry</FONT> &ndash; all my teacher's attempts to make me draw with a ruler and pencil came to nothing.</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Computer science</FONT> &ndash; fascinating digits and letters glowing on that TV/ typewriter hybrid.</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">History</FONT> &ndash; the textbook was packed with killer illustrations.</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Russian literature</FONT> &ndash; out of principle I wouldn't read the assigned works&mdash;I hate being told what to do.</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Chemistry</FONT> &ndash; always wondered if my neighbour's ruler would dissolve completely in sulfuric acid.</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Physics</FONT> &ndash; a charged capacitor left on the table made a great "gin and tonic" for curious types.</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">English</FONT> &ndash; I could never make out what that "cutie" was babbling or why she looked at me with such loving eyes.</B>
<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Geography</FONT> &ndash; like Ostap Bender I wondered where the country was where everyone wore white pants (Rio de Janeiro).</B></UL>
<B>As you can see, a whole range of subjects fascinated me for very different reasons.</B>

<P><B>When I decided I was done with secondary education (usually around 16), I had to pick a path. Because school never taught me to count properly and those mysterious symbols on the "hybrid" kept calling, I chose applied mathematics&mdash;hoping that by my fifth year I'd finally master counting.</B>

<P><B>So I found myself at the mystifying Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatics, specifically in the Information Systems department. The fifth year is almost over and I still can't count without a calculator. Alas!</B>
