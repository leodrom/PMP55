<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you've mysteriously landed on this page and aren't in a rush for the next few minutes, let's get acquainted.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you've probably guessed (let's assume you can read and managed to read the first line here) my name is Dima Zlatous. Dima is most likely the first name and Zlatous the last name (note the spelling is Zlatous, not Zlatoust—I make no claim to being related to John Chrysostom).</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born on September 20<IMG SRC="BOY7.GIF" HEIGHT=37 WIDTH=37 ALIGN=LEFT> 1976 (as expected on a Monday), an absolutely peculiar creature—just imagine what you get if you cross Virgo with a Dragon—in the city of Ivano-Frankivsk where my parents diligently chipped away at the hard rock (or something equally solid) of science.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my childhood years my temper was quite wild, so my parents were literally "chilled" by their offspring. I'd manage to soak or, even better, completely dirty the thing adults called "a diaper," or I'd start singing out of boredom (usually at night so I could enjoy my talent in the surrounding silence). Of course there were plenty of other amusing activities, but let's not dwell on them—I'm sure you had no fewer tricks to make your parents happy.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if you're not tired yet of my humble persona, let's continue. After all the tiring wanderings (Ivano-Frankivsk – Radomyshl – Kyiv) I had to "settle" (skiers will get me) in an unremarkable provincial town called Stryi. There I got to attend a cool kindergarten called "Little Red Riding Hood" (obviously the "riding hoods" were the kind teachers and the "wolves" you can probably guess yourself).</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the years allowed, I grabbed my bag and trudged off to gain wisdom in Secondary School No.7. Whenever I actually made it to class my knowledge grew before my eyes. The most memorable subjects were:</B>
<UL><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Algebra</FONT> – all my attempts to learn long division ended in complete failure and eventually I realized that the calculator is man’s best friend.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Geometry</FONT> – all attempts by the teacher (Remarenko Maya Nikonovna, a wonderful person and educator) to make me draw with a ruler and pencil were unsuccessful.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Computer Science</FONT> – extremely curious numbers and letters flashed on that hybrid of a TV and typewriter.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">History</FONT> – the whole book was packed with awesome pictures.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Russian Literature</FONT> – out of principle I never read the required works from the school program (I can’t stand being told what and when to do something).</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Chemistry</FONT> – I was always curious whether a classmate’s ruler would completely dissolve if thrown into sulfuric acid and what would happen if you dripped "this" into "that."</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Physics</FONT> – a charged capacitor left on the table always served as a good "gin and tonic" for curious personalities.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">English</FONT> – I could never understand what that "cutie" was babbling about or why she looked at me with such loving eyes.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Geography</FONT> – like the legendary Ostap Bender, I wondered where the country was where everyone walks around in white pants (meaning Rio de Janeiro).</B></UL>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, as you can see, I was interested in quite a few subjects for various reasons.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I decided it was time to quit secondary school (this usually happens around age 16) I had to choose which path to follow. Since I never really learned to count in school and those mysterious characters on that "hybrid" were calling to me, I decided to go for applied mathematics, hoping that by the fifth year I’d finally master that tricky art (that is, learn to count properly).</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I ended up in the puzzling Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatics, where I somehow landed in the Department of Information Systems. The fifth year is already drawing to a close and I still can’t count without a calculator. Alas! Alas? Alas.</B>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Literature</FONT> – I basically read everything in a row (curious, aren’t I). I really like V. Pikul. I highly recommend reading him—you’ll get loads of enjoyment. Probably like any person, I have a favorite book (as a kid it was "Dunno on the Moon") – "The Twelve Chairs" and "The Golden Calf" (I’ve reread them countless times).</B>
