  <P>I'm intrested of many different things.</P>
  <P>In winter I enjoy skiing with my friends in the Carpathians mountains.</P>
  <IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/IRLES/3KITTEN.JPG" ALIGN=RIGHT>
  <P>I also like animals, espesially cats.</P>
  <P>So I have this beautiful animal in my flat.</P>
  <P>I like spending free time with my boyfriend,
  <P>walking with him, visiting my friends.
  <P>Another thing I'd like to do, is travelling.
  <P>My blue dream is to travel all around the world.
  <P>If   I   have  free time, I read the books,
  <P>sing romantic songs, and play  piano.
