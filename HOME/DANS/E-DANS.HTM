<IMG SRC="BALL17.GIF" HSPACE=5 HEIGHT=29 WIDTH=29 ALIGN=TEXTTOP><I><U>A little about me</U></I></H2>
<B>I was born on a frosty winter day—around January&nbsp;7, 1976. If that date rings a bell—yes, it's Christmas. The years flew by in Lviv, a city in western Ukraine. I learned to read,
<IMG SRC="TIGER5.GIF" HEIGHT=84 WIDTH=43 ALIGN=RIGHT>
write and do all those clever things at secondary school&nbsp;No.&nbsp;31. It's already 1997 and knowledge keeps piling up. I'm even finishing my studies at Lviv State University, Faculty of Applied Mathematics—so that's what the mysterious <A HREF="../../NAVY/U-PMP-55.HTM#MARK" TARGET="NAVY">PMP-55</A> stands for.</B>
<BR><B>Logic suggests: I study applied math, you're reading this page, so you're learning about me. In a way I'm a provider of myself—what else are personal pages for?</B>
<BR><B>Through blood and sweat, often lacking sleep (not to mention food for the body and soul), I spent my free time at the computer—yes, that box hooked up to the "TV" you're looking at now, I hope with a smile. Eventually I realized it's not just a typewriter but also a way to earn money and meet interesting people on the Internet.</B>

<B>For a long time computers occupied all my thoughts. They were friends and brothers who tried, adapted and showed things—though not always what I wanted. Looking more critically I saw that not every error is the OS's fault. So I adapted to the machine and we achieved a kind of consensus.</B>

<BR><IMG SRC="HAGBARD.GIF" HEIGHT=53 WIDTH=56 ALIGN=RIGHT><B>Just a couple of years ago friends dragged me onto skis. It wasn't pleasant—everything hurt. But thanks to those who persuaded me to try again. I'm still alive and singing victory songs over the elements. I urge you to try this "suicide" too; instead of blood you'll feel pure adrenaline, and you'll have stories to tell—especially when everyone calls you a newbie.</B>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Music</FONT></I></B>
<BR><B>Life wouldn't be life without all kinds of sounds. I don't listen to everything—my hearing isn't great—but my tastes are wide. Music is for the mood: what I like today might annoy me tomorrow. Here's a sample list:</B>
<UL><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> Rave, House, Jungle—youth music that frees the mind so much it's hard to bring it back.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> Orbital—pleasant listening.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> Fluke—don't listen while driving or you'll forget where the brakes are.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> Classical music—I turn it on only when my thoughts are really tangled.</B></UL>

<B>Programming is a fickle world—you tear yourself between languages. Practice shows that's no good. I decided to stick to a few tools that seem promising:</B>
<UL><IMG SRC="BALL5.GIF" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14 ALIGN=TEXTTOP> <B><A HREF="http://borland.com">Borland</A> Pascal&nbsp;7.0—I've explored it thoroughly and I'm grateful to <I>Borland</I> for it.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="BALL5.GIF" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14 ALIGN=TEXTTOP> <B>Borland Delphi—worked with it enough to know it's perfect for building applications; great for beginners.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="BALL5.GIF" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14 ALIGN=TEXTTOP> <B>C++—powerful for serious programs, though I find its automatic actions too complex. I recommend <A HREF="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft Visual C++</A>.</B></UL>

<IMG SRC="BALL15.GIF" HSPACE=5 HEIGHT=29 WIDTH=29 ALIGN=TEXTTOP><I><U>The project I'm working on</U></I></H2>
<B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The problem.</FONT></I></B>
<BR><B>Imagine you have a text file full of interesting data. It's useful only if you present it in a more convenient form—lists, trees, whatever. That means writing bulky code to read the file and fill some structure. You've probably noticed another issue: who checks the data's correctness? Anyone familiar with compilers will sketch the syntax first, then write the reader.</B>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Our solution.</FONT></I></B>
<BR><B>You face that problem, but you're not a compiler guru. If you understand the structure of your data you can describe it as syntax diagrams. Our program includes an editor for building such diagrams visually—they're drawn faster than on paper. It's packaged as a component for Borland Delphi, so you can plug it into your products. We hope others will find it useful too.</B>
