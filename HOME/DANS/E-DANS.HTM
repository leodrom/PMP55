<IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL17.GIF" HSPACE=5 HEIGHT=29 WIDTH=29 ALIGN=TEXTTOP><I><U>Well, a little about myself</U></I></H2>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born on a cold winter day—of course I don't remember it—but it happened on January&nbsp;7, 1976&nbsp;AD. If those numbers make you wonder&nbsp;&mdash; yes, that's Christmas. The years passed in Lviv (a city in western Ukraine). I learned to read,&nbsp;<IMG SRC="TIGER5.GIF" HEIGHT=84 WIDTH=43 ALIGN=RIGHT>write and do other clever things at secondary school&nbsp;31. It's already 1997 and knowledge keeps filling my head; more than that, I'm finishing my studies at the Lviv State University, Faculty of Applied Mathematics (that's what the mysterious mark <A HREF="../../NAVY/U-PMP-55.HTM#MARK" TARGET="NAVY">PMP-55</A> means).</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's reason logically. I study applied mathematics, I have the knowledge gained at school, you are reading this page&nbsp;&mdash; logically you learn about me while I share that knowledge. It's no wonder I can be called a provider of myself. But why be surprised? Internet pages exist precisely for this.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through sweat and blood, often short on sleep (not to mention physical, moral and spiritual food), I spent my free time at the computer (that thing you connect to a "television," the one you're looking at now, I hope with a smile). Working with it I concluded: it's not only a typewriter but also a tool for making money, and on the Internet scale&nbsp;&mdash; a source of interesting acquaintances.</B>

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For quite a long time my thoughts revolved around computers. They were my friends and brothers who usually tried, adjusted, showed something, but unfortunately not always what you wanted. Looking closer I noticed not every error that occurred during work could be blamed on the operating system. So after some self-criticism I started adapting myself to the computer. In general we found total mutual understanding—a consensus.</B>

<BR><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/HAGBARD.GIF" HEIGHT=53 WIDTH=56 ALIGN=RIGHT><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not so long ago (two years back) I was dragged into alpine skiing. Honestly, it wasn't very pleasant. Everything that could hurt did hurt. I bow to those who persuaded me to repeat this feat. But as you can see I'm still alive and singing the song of the "conquerors of the elements." I persistently recommend trying this form of suicide and assure you that instead of blood your veins will be filled with adrenaline, plus you'll have something to remember (especially when everyone around calls you a "rookie").</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life wouldn't be life without sounds of every possible frequency surrounding you. <I>- How do you like my attempt to get to the music topic? -</I> I don't listen to everything—my ear isn't great. Still, the range of performers remains large. Maybe someone will agree: music is made for the right mood, meaning what I listen to today I might completely dislike tomorrow. Let me list some and you decide for yourself:</B>
<UL><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> Rave, House, Jungle (youth music that frees the mind so much it's hard to get it back)</B>

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programming is such a changeable thing that you have to split yourself into dozens of pieces between one language and another. Practice—the mother of theory—shows that this does no good. I decided to stick to a few things that, in my opinion, have prospects for the future.</B>
<UL><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL5.GIF" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14 ALIGN=TEXTTOP> <B><A HREF="https://www.borland.com" TARGET="_blank">Borland</A>
Pascal 7.0 (I've explored this environment thoroughly—I dare say to perfection—and I'm grateful to <I>Borland</I> for it)</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL5.GIF" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14 ALIGN=TEXTTOP> <B>Borland Delphi
(I worked with it enough to understand that this is exactly the language I needed for creating applications; I recommend it to beginners)</B>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL5.GIF" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14 ALIGN=TEXTTOP> <B>C++ (a powerful language for writing serious programs, though in my opinion overly complicated by its default actions—you write something and the compiler performs additional optimizations that often lead to "crashes"; I recommend using <A HREF="https://www.microsoft.com" TARGET="_blank">Microsoft Visual C++</A>).</B></UL>

<IMG SRC="BALL15.GIF" HSPACE=5 HEIGHT=29 WIDTH=29 ALIGN=TEXTTOP><I><U>The project I'm currently working on</U></I></H2>
<B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Let's start with the problem.</FONT></I></B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine a situation where you have a text file containing information you need. No matter how useful it is, you can work with it only if it's presented in a more convenient form (lists, trees and so on). To do that you have to write bulky code that correctly reads the text file and puts the data into some structure. If you've faced this problem you couldn't help but notice that reading data raises another issue: who will check its correctness? Anyone with at least some notion of how compilers are built will immediately think of sketching the syntax structure before starting on the reader.</B>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">What we came up with.</FONT></I></B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're facing the above problem. You haven't written a PhD thesis on building compilers and don't know how to approach it. We came up with this idea. If you fully understand the structure of the data you process, you can represent it with syntax diagrams.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our program includes an editor for visually building syntax diagrams. In our opinion it's very handy. For example, the diagrams are "drawn" faster than you would on a sheet of paper.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One advantage of this project is that it's written as a component for Borland Delphi. This allows you to plug it into your own software products.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope this component will be used not only by us but also by those who spend a lot of time solving this issue.</B>
