<IMG SRC="BALL17.GIF" HSPACE=5 HEIGHT=29 WIDTH=29 ALIGN=TEXTTOP><I><U>Well, a little about myself</U></I></H2>
<B>I was born in the chill of winter&mdash;of course I don't remember it myself&mdash;around January&nbsp;7, 1976. If those numbers make you ponder, let me remind you: Christmas. The years went by in Lviv, a city in western Ukraine. I learned to read,
<IMG SRC="TIGER5.GIF" HEIGHT=84 WIDTH=43 ALIGN=RIGHT>
write and all the other smart things at secondary school&nbsp;No.&nbsp;31. It's already 1997 and knowledge keeps filling my head; moreover I'm finishing my studies at Lviv State University at the faculty of applied mathematics (that's what the mysterious label <A HREF="../../NAVY/U-PMP-55.HTM#MARK" TARGET="NAVY">PMP-55</A> means).</B>
<BR><B>Let's think logically. I study applied mathematics, I have the knowledge I gained at school, you're reading this page&mdash;logically you learn about me and I'm providing that knowledge. It's not surprising you could call me a provider of myself. But why be surprised? That's what Internet pages are for.</B>
<BR><B>In blood and sweat, often short on sleep (not to mention physical, moral and spiritual food) I spent my free time at the computer&mdash;that thing you usually hook the "TV" to and are now staring at, hopefully with a smile. Working with it I concluded it's not just a typewriter but also a way to earn money and, across the Internet, a source of interesting acquaintances.</B>

<B>For quite a long time computers occupied all my thoughts. They were my friends and brothers who, as a rule, tried, adapted, showed something&mdash;alas, not always what you wanted. Looking at them more critically I realized not every error could be blamed on the operating system. So, turning the criticism on myself, I began to adapt to the computer. In the end we reached complete mutual understanding&mdash;a consensus, so to speak.</B>

<BR><IMG SRC="HAGBARD.GIF" HEIGHT=53 WIDTH=56 ALIGN=RIGHT><B>Not so long ago (two years back) I was dragged to alpine skiing. Frankly it wasn't much fun&mdash;everything that could hurt did. I bow to those who convinced me to repeat the feat. But as you see I'm still alive and singing the song of the "victors over the elements." Moreover I stubbornly recommend you try this kind of suicide and assure you that instead of blood your veins will pump pure adrenaline, and you'll have something to remember (especially when everyone around calls you a "newbie").</B>

<BR><B>Life wouldn't be life if you weren't surrounded by sounds of all kinds of frequency. <I>&ndash; How do you like my attempt to shift to the musical theme? &ndash;</I> I don't listen to everything&mdash;what can I do, my hearing isn't great. Still the range of performers is large. Maybe someone agrees: music is made for the right mood; what I listen to today I might totally reject tomorrow. Here's a list, you judge for yourself:</B>
<UL><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> Rave, House, Jungle (youth music that frees the mind so much it's hard to get it back)</B>

<B>Programming is such a changeable thing that you have to split into dozens between one language and another. As practice&mdash;the mother of theory&mdash;shows, that leads to nothing good. I decided to stick to a few things that in my opinion have prospects.</B>
<UL><IMG SRC="BALL5.GIF" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14 ALIGN=TEXTTOP> <B><A HREF="http://borland.com">Borland</A> Pascal&nbsp;7.0 (I explored this environment thoroughly&mdash;I won't hesitate to say perfectly&mdash;and I'm grateful to <I>Borland</I> for it)</B>

<P><IMG SRC="BALL5.GIF" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14 ALIGN=TEXTTOP> <B>Borland Delphi (I worked with it enough to realise it's exactly the language I needed for creating applications; recommended for beginners)</B>

<P><IMG SRC="BALL5.GIF" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14 ALIGN=TEXTTOP> <B>C++ (powerful enough for serious programs, though in my opinion overly complicated by its default actions&mdash;I write something and besides that the compiler applies its own optimisations which often lead to "breakage"; I recommend using <A HREF="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft Visual C++</A>.)</B></UL>

<IMG SRC="BALL15.GIF" HSPACE=5 HEIGHT=29 WIDTH=29 ALIGN=TEXTTOP><I><U>The project I'm working on now</U></I></H2>
<B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Let's start with the problem.</FONT></I></B>
<BR><B>Imagine a situation when you have a text file with some interesting information. But no matter how useful that information is, you can use it only if it's presented in a more convenient form (lists, trees, and so on). For this you have to write rather bulky code that correctly reads the data from the text file and places it into some structure. If you've faced such a problem you couldn't help noticing that reading the data is linked with another issue: who will check its correctness. Anyone who has at least some idea about compiler construction will immediately think to outline the syntax structure before starting on the reader.</B>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">What we came up with.</FONT></I></B>
<BR><B>The problem has arisen before you. You haven't written a thesis on building compilers and you don't know how to solve it. We came to this idea: if you fully imagine the structure of the data you process, you can present it as syntax diagrams.</B>
<BR><B>In our program we created an editor for visually constructing syntax diagrams. We think it turned out very convenient. For example, the diagrams are "drawn" faster than you would on paper.</B>
<BR><B>One advantage of this project is that it's written as a component for Borland Delphi. This allows it to be plugged into your software products.</B>
<BR><B>We hope this component will be used not only by us but also by those for whom solving this issue takes a lot of time.</B>
