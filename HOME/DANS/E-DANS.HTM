<IMG SRC="BALL17.GIF" HSPACE=5 HEIGHT=29 WIDTH=29 ALIGN=TEXTTOP><I><U>Well, a little about myself</U></I></H2>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born in the cold of winter; of course I do not remember it, but it was around January 7, 1976. If those digits make you think&mdash;that was Christmas. The years passed in Lviv, a city in Western Ukraine. I learned to read,
&nbsp;<IMG SRC="TIGER5.GIF" HEIGHT=84 WIDTH=43 ALIGN=RIGHT>
write and all the other smart things at secondary school #31. It is already 1997 and knowledge keeps filling my head; moreover I am finishing my studies at Lviv State University at the faculty of applied mathematics (that is what the mysterious sign <A HREF="../../NAVY/U-PMP-55.HTM#MARK" TARGET="NAVY">PMP-55</A> means).</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's think logically. I study applied mathematics, I have the knowledge I gained at school, you are reading this page &ndash; so logically you are learning about me and I in turn provide that. It is not surprising one could call me a provider of myself. But why be surprised? Internet pages exist for this.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In blood and sweat, often lacking sleep (not to mention physical, moral and spiritual food) I spent my free time at the computer (that's the thing you often connect the "TV" to that you are now staring at, I hope with a smile). Working with it I came to the conclusion &ndash; it's not only a typewriter but also a money-making device and, on the scale of the Internet, a source of interesting acquaintances.</B>

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For quite a long time all my thoughts were occupied by computers. They were my friends and brothers who, as a rule, tried, made attempts, adapted, showed something but unfortunately not always what you wanted. Looking at them more closely I noticed that not all errors that occurred could be blamed on the operating system. So, looking more critically at myself, I began to adapt to the computer. In general we found complete mutual understanding, so to speak, a consensus.</B>

<BR><IMG SRC="HAGBARD.GIF" HEIGHT=53 WIDTH=56 ALIGN=RIGHT><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not so long ago (two years back) I was dragged to alpine skiing. Honestly, it was not much fun. Everything that could hurt &ndash; did. I bow my head to those who persuaded me to repeat this feat. But as you see I am still alive and sing the song of "winners over the elements". Moreover I persistently recommend trying this kind of suicide and assure you that instead of blood only adrenalin will flow in your veins, and you'll have something to remember (especially when everyone around calls you a "newbie").</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life would not be life if you were not surrounded by sounds of all sorts of frequency. <I>&ndash; How do you like my attempt to move to the musical theme?</I> So, I don't listen to everything &ndash; what can you do, my hearing is poor. Still the range of performers stays large. Maybe someone agrees with me: music is created for the proper mood, that is what I listen to today I might totally reject tomorrow. Let me list some and you decide:</B>
<UL><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/BALL2.GIF" NOSAVE HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14><B> Rave, House, Jungle (youth music that frees the mind so much it's hard to get it back)</B>

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programming is such a changeable thing that you have to split into dozens between one language and another. As theory's mother practice shows &ndash; that leads to no good. I decided to stick to a few things that in my opinion have a future.</B>
<UL><IMG SRC="BALL5.GIF" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14 ALIGN=TEXTTOP> <B><A HREF="http://borland.com">Borland</A> Pascal 7.0 (I climbed all over this environment and mastered it, I won't fear the word, perfectly, and I'm grateful to <I>Borland</I> for it)</B>

<P><IMG SRC="BALL5.GIF" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14 ALIGN=TEXTTOP> <B>Borland Delphi (I worked with it enough to realise it's exactly the language I needed for creating applications; recommended for beginners)</B>

<P><IMG SRC="BALL5.GIF" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14 ALIGN=TEXTTOP> <B>C++ (powerful enough for serious programs, though in my opinion overly complicated by its default actions &ndash; I write something and besides that the compiler applies its optimisations which often lead to "breakage"; I recommend using <A HREF="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft Visual C++</A>).</B></UL>

<IMG SRC="BALL15.GIF" HSPACE=5 HEIGHT=29 WIDTH=29 ALIGN=TEXTTOP><I><U>The project I'm working on now</U></I></H2>
<B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Let's start with the problem.</FONT></I></B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine a situation where you have a text file containing interesting information. But no matter how useful that information is, you can use it only if it is presented in a more convenient form (lists, trees, etc.). For this you have to write rather bulky code that correctly reads the data from the text file and places it into one structure or another. If you've faced such a problem you couldn't help noticing that reading the data is linked with another issue: who will check the correctness of the data. A person who has at least some idea about compiler principles will immediately think to sketch the syntax structure before starting work on the reader.</B>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">What we came up with.</FONT></I></B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem above arose before you. You haven't written a PhD thesis about building compilers and you don't know how to solve it. We came to this idea. If you fully imagine the structure of the data you process you can present it as syntax diagrams.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our program we created an editor for visual construction of syntax diagrams. In our opinion it turned out very convenient. For example: the diagrams are "drawn" faster than you would do it on paper.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One plus of this project is that it's written as a component for Borland Delphi. This allows it to be plugged into your software products.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope this component will be used not only by us but also by those for whom solving this issue takes a lot of time.</B>
