<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+3>N</FONT></FONT>ow for a bit of history. In the summer of 1975&mdash;it sounds grand, though I'm sure it was ordinary&mdash;my parents finished Polytech, and my father was doing military training near the home of his future wife. He visited her often, naturally without telling me. Less than nine months later, on April&nbsp;7, 1976, I came into the world.

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT></FONT>hat's how it began. My first obsession was the pacifier (don't worry, I moved on). My cunning parents discovered they could quiet me with food or that pacifier. Like any boy I was soon drawn to anything on four wheels. My mother deserves credit&mdash;she pushed my stroller for a whole year. By the age of two or three I could read (cool, right?), then they decided not to spoil me and promptly un&ndash;taught me. I could go on about my "happy" childhood for ages, so let's skip a few years.

It's still around, numbered a stylish 46 (7&times;6+4 where 7 is my birth date, 4 the month and 6 the year's last digit). My favourite subjects were mathematics and later computer science&mdash;I never understood what the others found difficult. Almost everything else felt pointless to me. We'll skip the countless school stories. After ten years there (and they suffered me) I graduated quite well, though I'll spare the details.

I became a student (some say prisoner) of the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatics. Computer science was fine, but mathematics was a shock&mdash;distant and confusing.
