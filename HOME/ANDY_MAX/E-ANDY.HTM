As you've probably noticed my name is <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Andrij
Maxymovych</FONT>, among friends simply Maksik. In the computer world
I go by the nick Andy MAX. Now we are acquainted.

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+3>N</FONT></FONT>ow I'll tell how it
all started (as you understand I'll be speaking about myself). It all began
in the summer of 1975 (sounds cool, but as far as I guess it was quite
simple). My parents had just graduated from "Polytech" and my father was
serving his "sentence" at military training not far from the house where
his future wife lived (that is my future mom) and (without telling me) he
often visited her "as a guest" (I don't mind now). Less than nine months
passed when on April 7, 1976 my brightly expressed individuality came into
this world.

<P><IMG SRC="FW-R.GIF" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=79 WIDTH=92 ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT></FONT>hat's where it all began.
My first favourite pastime was a pacifier (don't think that hobby has lasted
until now). My cunning parents realised that to shut me up they had to give
me something to eat or trick me with a pacifier. Then, like any normal boy,
I was drawn to four-wheeled machines. My mom (credit where it's due) spent
a whole year faithfully pushing me in a stroller. At the age of two or three
I was taught to read (that was cool), and then they decided not to ruin my
childhood and... untaught me 8-( . Stop (that's to myself)! I could talk
about my "happy" childhood for a very long time, so let's skip a few years.

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT></FONT>fter kindergarten I went
to school. Oh! What a school it was (it still exists). And its number was
cool - 46 (46 = 7 * 6 + 4, where 7 is my birth date, 4 is the month and 6 is
the last digit of the year). My favourite subjects at school were first
mathematics and later computer science - I could never understand what other
pupils didn't get in these subjects. And my so to speak "least favourite"
were almost all the rest - I couldn't grasp what my classmates saw in them.
Let's not dwell on school, though besides studying there is much to remember.
So having "suffered" through 10 years of school (they tolerated me no less),
I finished it. Rather well, by the way (I won't say exactly how).

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT></FONT>hen my "thorny" path carried
me to the Ivan Franko University (or in short "IF castle"). I became a
student (the so-called "prisoner of IF castle") of the Faculty of Applied
Mathematics and Informatics (feel the connection with school? :-). While I
had no problems with computer science, mathematics simply stunned me (it was
something distant and unclear).
