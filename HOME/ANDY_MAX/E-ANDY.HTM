<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+3>N</FONT></FONT>ow I'll tell you how it all began. In the summer of 1975&mdash;it sounds dramatic, but I'm sure it was quite simple&mdash;my parents had just finished "Polytech," and my father was serving his duty at military training near the house where his future wife lived. He often visited her, without telling me of course. Less than nine months later, on April&nbsp;7, 1976, my distinctly individual self entered this world.

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT></FONT>hat's where my story starts. My first passion was a pacifier (rest assured, I outgrew it). My cunning parents knew they could silence me only with food or by fooling me with that pacifier. Like any normal boy I was soon fascinated by anything on four wheels. Credit to my mother&mdash;she faithfully pushed my stroller for a whole year. By the age of two or three I could read (pretty cool), and then they decided not to spoil my childhood and un‑taught me. Stop! I could talk about my "happy" childhood forever, so let's skip ahead a few years.

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT></FONT>fter kindergarten I went to school. What a school it was&mdash;it's still around. Its number was a stylish 46 (7×6+4, where 7 is my birth date, 4 the month, and 6 the last digit of the year). My favourite subjects were mathematics first and later computer science&mdash;I never understood what the others found difficult. My "least" favourite were nearly all the rest&mdash;I just couldn't see what my classmates enjoyed in them. We'll skip most of the school stories. After surviving ten years there (and they survived me) I graduated quite well, though I'll keep the details to myself.

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT></FONT>hen my winding path brought me to Ivan Franko University, affectionately called the "IF castle." I became a student&mdash;some say prisoner&mdash;of the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatics (notice the link with school? :-). Computer science gave me no trouble, but mathematics was a real shock&mdash;something remote and unclear.
