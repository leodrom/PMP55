<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am Valeriy Trushevsky. I study at Lviv University.
I am the fifth year student of Applied Mathematics and Informatics Faculty.
I was born on September, 8, 1976. I finished school number52. Since I had
been attending Greco-Roman fight circle for seven years, I was meant to
be a sportsman. But under the circumstances (after the sixth form) I continued
my studies in the mathematics class under the guidance of Orach. Since
when I had been working hard on mathematics. In the 11th form I look part
in a contest and obtained good results. Thanks to them I was enrolled for
the Applied Mathematics Faculty. I specialisation in interval methods for
solving problems. This is the theme of my diploma paper. After the graduation
I am going to take my Master's Degree, so I'll be able to continue my studies
of intervals (to keep on studying the intervals). At leisure I like to
play basketball. I go in for sports to keep myself in good shape.</B>
