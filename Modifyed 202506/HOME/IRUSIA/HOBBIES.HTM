  <P>I enjoy many different forms of art and music. I'm very much into 
  <P>classical music and art, and often wonder about  a simpler time 
  <P>past  when beauty seemed to be more important to people in everything 
  <P>that they did. One of my favorite things to do in life is to cook 
  <P>for my son & for my friends. I also like travellig with my friends 
  <P>& spending time with my little son. Another things I'd like to do is
  <P> to read the books, espesially scince fiction</P>
