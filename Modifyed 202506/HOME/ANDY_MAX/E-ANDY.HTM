As you've probably already noticed, my name is <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Andriy Maksymovych</FONT>, among friends just Maksyk. In the computer world,
you can find me under the nickname Andy MAX. So now we are acquainted.

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+3>N</FONT></FONT>ow let me tell you how it all began (as you understand, this will be about myself). It all started
in the summer of 1975 (sounds cool, but as far as I guess, it was pretty
simple). My parents had just graduated from “Polytechnic” and my father was “serving his duty”
at military training camps not far from the house where his future wife lived
(that is, my future mother) and (without informing me) he often visited
her “as a guest” (which I have no objection to now). Nine months
later, on April 7, 1976, my vividly expressed individuality entered
this world.

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT></FONT>hat’s how it all started. My first favorite activity was a pacifier (don’t think
this hobby lasted until now). My clever parents realized that in order to shut me up… oops…
they needed to give me something to eat or fool me with a pacifier.
Then, like any normal boy, I got interested in four-wheeled machines.
My mom (credit to her) carried me in a stroller diligently for a whole year.
At the age of two or three, I was taught to read (that was cool),
but then they decided not to ruin my childhood and … untaught me 😦. Stop
(that was to myself)! I could talk about my “happy” childhood for a long time,
so let’s skip a few years. . . . . . .

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT></FONT>fter kindergarten
I went to school. Oh! What a school it was (in fact, it still exists)
!!! And it had a cool number – 46 (46 = 7 * 6 + 4, where 7 is my birth date,
4 the month, and 6 the last digit of the year). My favorite subjects at school
were initially math and later computer science – I just couldn’t understand
why others didn’t get it. And my, let’s say, “least favorite” subjects
were almost all the others – I just couldn’t understand what my classmates
saw in them. We won’t dwell too much on school, although apart from
studying there are things to remember. So, after “suffering through” 10 years of school
(they tolerated me there no less), I finished it. And quite well, by the way (though I won’t say how).

<P><IMG SRC="Fb-r.gif" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=54 WIDTH=97 ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT></FONT>hen my “thorny” path
led me to Ivan Franko University (or briefly, “Castle IF”).
And I became a student (so-called “prisoner of Castle IF”) of the Faculty of “Applied
Mathematics and Informatics” (see the connection to school? :-). And while
I had no problems with computer science, mathematics simply stunned me
(it was something distant and incomprehensible).
