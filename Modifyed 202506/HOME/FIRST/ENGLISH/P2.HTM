  My studying
</H1>
So, that dull part of my story told you about the studying.
<BR>I'd rather not tire you the story of my tortures during those years.
The main points are described on <A HREF="P1.HTM">the previous page</A>.
<P> My blooming, unconguoerble laziness prevents me from
understanding the demands of my poor teachers. But I can't
help admiring their heroic effors. Now I easily can find a
difference derivative and integral, matrix and vector,
Dirihle and Neyman, "any key" and "Reset", Windows and
Norton'�, thin and thik (Ethernet), com1 and com2, Roman
Yevstahovych and Perto Vasyl'ovych. Agressive approaches
from Assembler to Pascal, from Pascal to C, from C to Paradox,
from Paradox to Delphi in the long run resulted my several
best scores in Minesweeper. Also it gave me the ability to
write the program in this languages that will mayby work
(hm... and mayby not). At the glorious end of studying I
came to the conclusion that I hadn't became a famous
programmer but I veture to cosider me to be something more
then a common User.
